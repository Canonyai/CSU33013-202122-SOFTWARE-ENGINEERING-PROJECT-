The proposed system is to create a web app that enables user to search for a news and then automatically summarize the news once they click on it 


For the frond end we have decided on using Django's templates. We chose it for the following reasons:
•	Django provides an abstraction layer (the “models”) for structuring and manipulating the data of your web application.
•	Django has the concept of “views” to encapsulate the logic responsible for processing a user’s request and for returning the response.
•	The template layer provides a designer-friendly syntax for rendering the information to be presented to the user
•	Django provides a rich framework to facilitate the creation of forms and the manipulation of form data.
• We used CSS and HTML extensively as the languages.


•	
For the backend we have used the Newspaper3k API, along with spaCy, Beautiful Soup, textblob, as requested by our client. These has API had many advantages:
•	Newspaper is an amazing python library for extracting & curating articles.
•	Newspaper has seamless language extraction and detection. If no language is specified, Newspaper will attempt auto detect a language.

•	Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favourite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching and modifying the parse tree.
•	 spaCy is a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python

We used MongoDB as out database - 
•	MongoDB is a NoSQL database with the scalability and flexibility that was needed along with the querying and indexing.

For version control we used Github. We use pull requests to contribute code and each pull request required a review from two other members to be merged into the main branch. We were able to provide comments and feedback on contributed work and request changes.
